Converting a normal photograph into a cartoon-style image involves transforming the original image to mimic the simplified and exaggerated features characteristic of cartoons. This transformation is achieved through a combination of image processing techniques, including edge detection, color quantization, and stylization. The K-means clustering algorithm plays a crucial role in this process by clustering similar pixel colors and simplifying the color palette.

Tech Stack:

1. Python: Python is used as the primary programming language for implementing the image processing pipeline and applying the K-means clustering algorithm.
2. OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful library for image processing and computer vision tasks. It provides functions for edge detection, color manipulation, and feature extraction.
3. Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python that includes implementations of various clustering algorithms, including K-means clustering.
4. Matplotlib: Matplotlib is used for visualizing images and displaying the results of the image processing pipeline.
